# Landing Page

For this project, I created an entire web page from a provided design. The point of this assignment is to create something from scratch and get the various elements in more or less the right position relative to the rest.

In this project, I heavily employed CSS's box model and flexbox to manipulate elements. The web page is not mobile-friendly at this moment, and will be updated as I progress throughout The Odin Project curriculum.
